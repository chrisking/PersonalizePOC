This service like many within AWS will automatically scale based on demand but if latency is critical you may want to provision ahead to the larger demand. Given this is purely a POC and a demo, all capacity limits are set to 1. The code below will just create the campaigns. Again in previous notebooks you may have seen while loops that polled, given that we want to execute multiple deployments at the same time the loops have been removed. Progress will be checked in another tab via the console just as you did for the solution version creation. This time instead of clicking on `Solutions and recipes` click the `Campaigns` link to the right to see their progress."
